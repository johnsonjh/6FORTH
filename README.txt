6FORTH is a floating point FORTH language interpreter.

6FORTH supports a small subset of the standard FORTH vocabulary.

This program is a revision of 'TINY.FORTH' written by David Malmberg,
originally published in "Commodore Power/Play", Volume 4, Number 1,
Pg. 104-111, February/March 1985, written in LOGO, translated to C
by Kathy Larkin for Honeywell/Bull CP-6 and GCOS-8.

The FORTH language is stack oriented.  That is, all numeric arguments are
put on a stack.  FORTH uses Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) where arithmetic
operators follow their arguments.  For example, 3 + 4 becomes 3 4 +, and
(9 - 8)/(7 * 6) becomes 9 8 - 7 6 * /.

 The FORTH vocabulary includes:

   - Arithmetic operators: +, -, *, /
   - Stack manipulation words: DUP, DROP, SWAP, OVER
   - Logical comparison words: >, =, <, 0>, 0=, 0<, NOT, MIN, MAX, ABS
   - Variable manipulation words: VARIABLE, @, !
   - Execution control words: DO...LOOP, I, LEAVE, IF...THEN, IF...THEN...ELSE,
     BEGIN...UNTIL, BEGIN...WHILE...REPEAT
   - Other words: VLIST, ., .", EMIT, :, LIST, FORGET, CR, ABORT, COLD, SAVE,
     LOAD, HELP, QUIT

 Arithmetic operators:

 Syntax            Stack Contents      Description

 +                 (n2 n1 -- sum)      Replaces top two numbers on the stack
                                       with their sum.
 -                 (n2 n1 -- diff)     Subtracts n1 from n2.
 *                 (n2 n1 -- prod)     Multiplies top two numbers.
 /                 (n2 n1 -- quot)     Divides n2 by n1.

 Examples:

 5 72.6 +                              Puts 77.6 on the top of the stack.
 999.9 99.9 - . CR                     Prints 900.0, leaves stack unchanged.
 5 4 3 * *                             Puts 60.0 on the stack ((3*4)*5).
 6 5 4 3 * * /                         Puts 0.10 on the stack (((3*4)*5)/6).
 34 8 + 3 2 * /                        Puts 7.0 on the stack ((34+8)/(3*2)).

 Stack manipulation words:

 Syntax            Stack Contents      Description

 DUP               (n -- n n)          Duplicates the top number.
 DROP              (n -- )             Discards top number.
 SWAP              (n2 n1 -- n1 n2)    Exchanges top two numbers.
 OVER              (n2 n1 -- n2 n1 n2) Puts copy of second number on top.

 Examples:

 6 7 OVER DUP                          Leaves stack with 6 7 6 6.
 6 7 DROP DUP                          Leaves stack with 6 6.
 6 7 OVER SWAP DROP                    Leaves stack with 6 6.
 6 DUP *                               Leaves 36 on the stack (squares 6).

 Logical comparison words:

 Syntax            Stack Contents      Description

 >                 (n2 n1 -- flag)     True if n2 is greater than n1.
 =                 (n2 n1 -- flag)     True if top two numbers are equal.
 <                 (n2 n1 -- flag)     True if n2 is less than n1.
 0>                (n -- flag)         True if top number is positive.
 0=                (n -- flag)         True if top number is zero.
 0<                (n -- flag)         True if top number is negative.
 NOT               (flag1 -- flag2)    Reverses value of flag.
 MIN               (n2 n1 -- min)      Leaves lesser of two top numbers.
 MAX               (n2 n1 -- max)      Leaves greater of two top numbers.
 ABS               (n -- abs)          Gives absolute value of top number.

 Examples:

 5 3 - 0>                              Puts true (1.0) on the stack.
 -5 3 >                                Puts false (0.0) on the stack.
 10 5 4 MAX DUP * *                    Puts 250.0 (= 5 * 5 * 10) on the stack.
 11 1 DO MIN LOOP                      Leaves minimum of top 10 numbers on
                                       the stack.
 5 3 + 8 = IF ." Equal! " THEN CR      Prints 'Equal!'.
 5 3 - 8 = IF ." Equal! " ELSE ." Not Equal! " CR    Prints 'Not Equal!'.

 Variable manipulation words:

 Syntax            Stack Contents      Description

 VARIABLE xxx      (n -- )             Creates a variable named xxx with an
                                       initial value equal to n.
 xxx @             ( -- n)             (Fetch) Puts the current value of the
                                       variable xxx on the stack.
 xxx !             (n -- )             (Store) Sets the value of the variable
                                       xxx to n.

 Examples:

 5 VARIABLE FIVE                       Creates variable FIVE with value = 5.
 4 FIVE @ +                            Puts 9 on the stack (given FIVE = 5).
 35 20 - VARIABLE DIFF                 Creates DIFF with value = 15.
 DIFF @ FIVE @ - DIFF !                Changes value of DIFF to 10.

 IF...THEN         (flag -- )          Executes words between IF and THEN if
                                       flag is true.
 IF...ELSE...THEN  (flag -- )          Executes words between IF and ELSE if
                                       flag is true, and words between ELSE
